# Data Structures & Algorithms – Logic Repository  
This repository is a structured collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) solutions, focused on clear logic, step-by-step thinking, and reusable patterns rather than just final answers.  
The goal of this repo is to help learners, interview candidates, and developers understand how to think while solving DSA problems.  🎯 Purpose of This Repository

📌 Dump and organize DSA logic in a clean and readable way
📌 Explain why a solution works, not just what it is
📌 Act as a revision + reference repo for interviews and competitive programming  
📌 Enable others to reuse logic, patterns, and approaches
